"""Write a fizzBuzz() function with a single integer parameter named upTo. For the numbers 1
up to and including upTo, the function prints one of four things:
感rints 'FizzBuzz' if the number is divisible by 3 and 5.
感rints 'Fizz' if the number is only divisible by 3.
感rints 'Buzz' if the number is only divisible by 5.
感rints the number if the number is neither divisible by 3 nor 5."""
