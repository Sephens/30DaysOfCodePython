    By Steve

    I am thinking of a {}-digit number with no repeated digits.
    Try to guess what it is. Here are some clues:
    When I say:         That means:
        Pico :       One digit is correct but in the wrong position.
        Fermi :      One digit is correct and in the right position.
        Bagels :     No digit is correct.

    For example, if the secret number was 248 and your guess was 843, the
    clues would be Fermi Pico.'''.format(NUMBER_OF_DIGITS))
